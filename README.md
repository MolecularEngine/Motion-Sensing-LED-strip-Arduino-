How to make motion sensing LEDs, using a motion sensor, microcontroller, and LED strip


 Updated 1 minute ago
This is a project that will allow you to build your own motion sensing lights, using an Arduino (it can be Uno or Nano, but a Nano is recommended for purposes of space.), a HC-SR501 PIR Motion IR Sensor, a power module, breadboard, and a LED strip. You can use what you want for power but I used a bread board power module. With these three things you can make motion sensing LEDs. I originally came up with this idea for closet lights, but you can use them for any application necessary. For right now there is no suggestion chip for the LED strip but I can update this later with more information. In terms of code ill be using Arduino code, so make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed.
